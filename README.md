# Trying out microservices

This project is focused on learning microservices, a thing I hear a lot about but don't really get a chance to use. My goal is to create a more or less production ready project that collects data on the stock market. I chose stock market data because it's something that I'm relatively interested in and there's a lot of it.

I will be building off my learnings from Stephen Grider's Docker and Kubernetes course on udemy.
